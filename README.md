# Trafotin

I hate technology but love to fix it.

I am not a professional developer or programmer. I'm glad I can go to work and not think about the cyberpunk dystopia that is technology.

## Watch My Videos
I make videos on YouTube and Odysee. These are typically involving the technology I use, think about, and practical uses. I am a Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS poweruser. I also watch all of the awful Big Tech events and lots of developer conventions.
